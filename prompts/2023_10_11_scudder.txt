I need to write an email on Linkedin to David Scudder. 
Here's the facts I need to incorporate. 

WE first met in April 2021, that was right around the time my last contract started.
That contract stretched 2 years until June 2023.  
When it ended, I took time to sharpen the saw. 
I then turned my attention to bolstering my data science knowledge. 
I took over 12 data science courses on Coursera; mostly at the intermediate level. 
I've learned about and have been using CHAT GPT 4 to accelerate my coding. 

I'm looking for a machine learning engineering/data science position. Either here in Philadelphia or remote. 
What sets me apart is that I'm a data scientist who speaks the language of business. Before coming back to technical in 2018 I was in management roles for 12 years in wireless.
I have an MBA and MS in Managerial science. 
Speaking the language of business means understanding big picture, managing up, being able to independently carry projects forward with minimal babysitting or hand holding. 

Thank him sufficiently in advance for his help. Ask him what if anything else he needs from me. Offer that I will try to help in the future if possible.
