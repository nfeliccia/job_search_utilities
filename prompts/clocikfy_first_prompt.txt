I will need several python functions to process the ouput of reports from the "Clockify" time tracking service. 
We'll start with just one. Lets use PANDAS 

The data is in a CSV which is located in the project root directory ".\Data\time_tracking_data"
The first thing we want to do is look in that directory and get the most recent file and work on that file. 

Here is the structure of the file

Project - Categorical
Client - Categorical
Description - String 
Task - String
User - Categorical
Email - Categorical
Tags - String
Billable - Boolean representanted as Yes or No
Start Date - date in the format of mm/dd/yyyy
Start Time - time in the format of h:mm:ss AM  
End Date - date in the format of mm/dd/yyyy
End Time - time in the format of h:mm:ss AM  
Duration (h) - Delta between Start and end in HH:MM:SS
Duration (decimal) decimal hours of duration. This is going to be the column we're most interested in. 

The first request is going to be pretty simple. 
Let's load in the latest data in that folder. Assign it to a PANDAS data frame with the correct data types. 
Let's get a table which shows the total number of hours worked per year - week combination over the timespan of the file.
We will use the week starting on Monday! 
Save that as an excel spreadsheet in the same folder from which we got the source file. 
We'll name the file the same as the input file, except with  _by_week added to the root of the file name. 
We'll name the tab in the file "by week"
