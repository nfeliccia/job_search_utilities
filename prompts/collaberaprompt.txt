I need a python script today called collabera.py

This script will use Selenium to open urls and interact with a web  page. 
This script must first open up the website  https://collabera.com/submit-resume/

Then if the following button exists, click it. //*[@id="wt-cli-accept-all-btn"]

It will take data from the reference_values.py file. 
It will use the values in the actual_values reference values class to fill in the following.

Fill the box at this xpath //*[@id="firstname"] with actual_values.first_name
Fill the box at this xpath //*[@id="lastname"] with actual_values.last_name
Fill the box at this xpath //*[@id="email"] with actual_values.email
Fill the box at this xpath //*[@id="number"] with actual_values.phone
Fill the box at this xpath //*[@id="linprofile"] with actual_values.linkedin_url
click the box at this xpath //*[@id="exampleCheck3"] if unchecked. 
 
click on the upload button at this xpath  //*[@id="wpcf7-f8654-o1"]/p/span/div/div/div/div/div/a
and send the string of current resume path. 

ask user to hit enter after clicking the captcha box. 


create a command line input which follows the same convention as tech_in_motion.py which I've also uploaded. 
Please use as much of tech_in_motion.py as a template for what you need to do. 


//*[@id="wpcf7-f8654-o1"]/div[7]/p/button
