Greetings. I have a file called tandymtech_reader.py which I just uploaded for you.

Right now it only opens one URL 
I wish to add the following functionality.
s
Open this URL in an additional tab. https://tandymtech.com/job-seekers/tech-search-results/?keyword=(Remote)&where=
Also click eu_conf_button = //*[@id="hs-eu-confirmation-button"]
If the button with the following xpath /html/body/section/section/div/aside/section/section/div[10]/div[1]/input    is not checked, then check it.
Quit everything after the user hits enter. 


that is working! 
Re read the code and baseline yourself. 
Lets do this.
Add parameter types to the function inputs.
Add parameter types to the docstrings google style.

In this HTML 
<p class="load-more-data ng-binding" data-ng-click="list.loadMoreData();" data-ng-show="list.SearchService.helper.hasMore &amp;&amp; list.SearchService.currentListData.length" style="">Load more...</p>
there is text that says load more. 
Iteratively click on it until it is no longer there. 




Ok. I need a python script called tandym_resume_uploader.py
The script will do the following

Open this url. https://tandym-portal.bullhorncloud.com/#/signup/000/init
I've attached the contents of that URL in the attached file called The Tandym Group Candidate Portal.html in the zip file. 

have a command line argument called use_actual_data which defaults to false.
if use actual data is true, it will load the variable actual_values of type ReferenceValues form the reference_values.py file.

Wait one second.
print("Website successfully opened")

In the area called "Drop file here, or click here to upload file, I want to upload the file at the path indicated by current_resume_path in either actual_values or dummy_values
Then when that is done, click on <span class="nextSectionIcon glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-right"></span>
Wait until we get the phrase  
Your resume was parsed successfully! Please click the next button to start editing the form!
the html for the form is in 
The Tandym Group Candidate Porta_bl.html and folder The Tandym Group Candidate Porta_bl
