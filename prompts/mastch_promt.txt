Greetings. I need to make a python script that searches for job openings at mastech.

I have created similar readers for other urls where I am looking for jobs. 
The code is attached in the zipfile called readers.py

The job url is https://careers-mastec.icims.com/jobs/search

Parameters are open via URL Parameters. 
Here is an example.
https://careers-mastec.icims.com/jobs/search?ss=1&searchKeyword=Data+Science&searchRelation=keyword_all

First open up the general search URL . Then  open up tabs for keyword search Machine Learning, Data Science , and Python. 
Use what has been done in the scripts on readers.zip as a template. 
name this function mastec_reader.py
include an if __name__=="__main__" clause to start 
Put the meat of the code ina  function called mastech_reader with a keyword argument testmode which defaults to false.
Before driver.quit() at the end , put in a prompt for the user to hit enter to proceed.
