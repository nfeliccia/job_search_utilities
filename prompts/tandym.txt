Greetings. 

Today I need a Python script using Selenium which will open the browser to the following URL 
https://tandymtech.com/job-seekers/tech-search-results/?keyword=&where=19124,%20Philadelphia,%20Pennsylvania

If the button with the XPath of //*[@id="hs-eu-confirmation-button"] exists. 
The name of the script should be tandymtech.py

No. I have all of the requirements installed.  

How about the following changes
1) in the exception we put a Print("Something went wrong")
2) In the main clause, put a press enter to continue input line.
