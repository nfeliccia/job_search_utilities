I want to create a python script using selenium. 

I want to open the careers website at susquehanna international group. 
I have attached a zip file called sig_job_results.zip which has the extracted HTML from a search.

The webstie takes  queries in the url according to the following format https://careers.sig.com/search-results?keywords=%22Data%20Science%22

I want to open a chrome browser in selenium, and open three tabs, with the following keywords
"Data Science"
"Machine Learning"
"Python"


Examine all three open tabs.  If there is a checkbox in there that says Bala Cynwyd (Philadelphia Area), Pennsylvania United States, click it. 
Prompt user to hit enter to continue so the window doesn't close

I'm uploading a copy of the script as I have it workign on MY machine. 
Ok. Checking the box that says Bala Cynwyd is  working on the first page , where its checking the box It is working on the second page where There is no box.
However the script is not working on the third page. I am uploading another zip. this zip file This zip file has thrid_page.html and third_page_files.
prehaps you could examine the HTML there and see if there's anything different which would make the css selector not work.
