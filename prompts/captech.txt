Greetings. I need to make a python script that searches for job openings at captechconsulting.

I have created similar readers for other urls where I am looking for jobs. 
The code is attached in the zipfile called readers.py

captechconsulting.com does the search via URL parameters
First open up a window using selenium to this URL https://www.captechconsulting.com/careers/current-openings
Then open up tab in that same browswer with all of the positions for Philadelphia. https://www.captechconsulting.com/careers/current-openings?page=1&location=253788  

Then we want to open up url's based on keywords. The url format is as follows. 
https://www.captechconsulting.com/careers/current-openings?page=1&keywords=Data%20Science

Lets open up tabs for keyword search Machine LEarning, Data Science , and Python. 
Use what has been done in the scripts on readers.zip as a template.
